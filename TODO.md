*   Once IDoneThis figures out why their v2 API only pulls 25 entries from a team entries call,
    get back to work on RESTPopulation.  When that happens, it's probably time to refactor the
    subclasses out into their own files, e.g. "ireportedthis/populations/rest_population.py",
    instead of just burying the subclasses in "ireportedthis/population.py". (mgs, 10/10/2016)
